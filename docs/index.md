# Welcome to arolariu.ro **documentation** platform

## About this website

This website is built using `DocFX` and is hosted on `GitHub Pages`.

I've built this website for three main reasons:

- To learn how to use a _static site generator_ (DocFX) in-depth.
- To offer a way for me to document my projects in a more structured way.
- To build my own [**personal brand**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_branding) and to have a place where I can showcase my work.

## Why `DocFX`?

DocFX is a static site generator for documentation, which is exactly what I need.

DocFX is open-source and is maintained by Microsoft, the company that I work for.
This means that if I have any issues with it, I can easily get in touch with the developers.

DocFX is able to generate documentation from a variety of sources, including Markdown, which is what I'm using.
Moreover, DocFX can gather documentation from multiple sources (such as XML files, code comments, assemblies metadata) and is able to generate a single website.

## Why `GitHub Pages`?

I've chosen to deploy this website as a statci web application, since, in the end, it's a static site that contains documents.

I've had in mind two deployment options:

- Deployment via a GitHub Workflow (Action) to a static web application hosting service (e.g. Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, etc.).
- Deployment via a GitHub Workflow (Action) to GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages are free and extremely easy to get started with.

GitHub Pages offer a free HTTPS certificate, which is a must-have for any website nowadays.

Moreover, GitHub Pages are integrated well with the GitHub ecosystem (who would've known?) and are easy to configure.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Perhaps in the future I'll move to a different hosting service, but for now, GitHub Pages are more than enough.

## How to navigate the website

If you are on a desktop device (that is, a _big screen_), you can use the navigation menu on the left side of the screen to navigate the website.

If you are on a mobile device (that is, a _small screen_), you can use the navigation menu on the top of the screen to navigate the website.

The `documentation` structure (or _category_) is currently as follows:

> - Index (the page you are currently reading)
> - API Documentation
>   - `arolariu` namespace
>     - `arolariu.backend` namespace
>     - `arolariu.frontend` namespace
>     - ......
>   - ......
> - ....

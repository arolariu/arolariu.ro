## My thoughts on the event

The GitHub Accelerator provided a valuable opportunity to connect with fellow open source maintainers and gain insights from their experiences. I gained a wealth of knowledge on project growth and sustainability, enhancing my own projects.

Being the inaugural edition, the event proved to be a resounding success. I anticipate GitHub's commitment to organizing future iterations of this event, fostering continued collaboration and learning.

While the event was not without minor hiccups expected from a debut edition, such as audio and video issues in the initial ~15 minutes, swift resolutions were implemented, ensuring a smooth conference experience. However, I believe that the organizers could have conducted more comprehensive platform testing prior to the event, considering GitHub's stature as a prominent tech giant.

All in all, the GitHub Accelerator left a positive impression as a remarkable event, and I eagerly look forward to its future editions.

## My notes on the projects

### Analog JS

![Analog JS logo](../../github-accelerator/analog-logo.svg)

Analog JS is an exciting fullstack meta-framework designed for building applications and websites using Angular.
This project holds great promise, offering developers the ability to create both frontend and backend components seamlessly.

Built on the foundation of Angular, a widely popular frontend framework, Analog JS showcases impressive usability through its intuitive demo.
The framework's similarities to Next.js, a renowned frontend framework for React, are worth noting.

Upon evaluation, I awarded this project a rating of **8 out of 10** based on its presentation.
However, I deducted **1 point** due to the presenter's fragmented delivery, resulting in a challenging comprehension experience.

Additionally, another **1 point** was deducted as the presentation proved rather concise, leaving several topics insufficiently covered.
Thus, my familiarity with the project, without further research, is limited to the following highlights:

Evident ease of use.
Comprehensive fullstack meta-framework leveraging Angular.
Utilization of a file-based routing system akin to Next.js.
While the presentation's brevity left me yearning for additional insights, the potential of Analog JS remains undeniably intriguing.

### AtriLabs Engine

"The Python web framework to build production-grade apps."

Except that what was presented in the demo was a typescript project, not a python project.

From a personal standpoint, this project failed to capture my enthusiasm, as it simply did not resonate with me.

In terms of rating, I assigned it a modest score of **5 out of 10**, primarily due to the following drawbacks:

- Deducted **1 point** as glimpses of Python code were observed during the demo, contrary to the predominantly TypeScript environment.
- Docked **2 points** due to the presenter's rapid tab-switching, making it challenging to follow the presentation seamlessly.
- Withheld another **2 points** as the project's overall presentation seemed bewildering.

Curiously, a visit to the project's GitHub page reveals surprising language distribution:

67.5% JavaScript
30.6% TypeScript
1.8% Python...
Despite these statistics, AtriLabs Engine appears to be a framework that potentially caters to the no-code/low-code/code generator niche, indicating inherent capabilities.

Nevertheless, comprehending the exact market or specific use cases for a project like this eludes me, and I apologize for the lack of clarity on this matter.

### HTMX

![HTMX logo](../../github-accelerator/htmx-logo.png)

Behold HTMX, a project that piqued my interest from the very beginning.

Now, this project seemed very interesting to me.

Throughout the presentation, my mind fixated on the potential synergy between Web Components and HTMX.
Combining these technologies could yield remarkable results.

The presenter demonstrated remarkable proficiency, delivering a well-structured presentation that showcased their seasoned expertise in product pitches.
I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

As a junior developer, I previously encountered XHTML, appreciating its ingenious concept.
Upon discovering HTMX, a sense of nostalgia washed over me, reigniting my excitement.

Considering the overall package, I bestowed a commendable rating of **9 out of 10**, with only one minor drawback:

- A slight deduction of **1 point** arose from my desire to witness a broader array of examples, extending beyond the limited showcase.

In summary, HTMX emerges as a powerful tool, streamlining web development with simplicity and elegance. Its potential for creative utilization appears vast, making it a promising addition to the developer's toolkit.

### Dioxus

![Dioxus logo](../../github-accelerator/dioxus-logo.png)

Dioxus, in my opinion, seemed like an Electron alternative, built in Rust.

However, what got me interested in this project was the fact that it was built in Rust.

Unfortunately, the presenter seemed to be rather nervous, and it was hard to follow the presentation.
I did not completely understand what this project is about, and I did not understand what it really does, besides being an Electron alternative.

I would have liked to learn more about this project, but the presentation seemed too short.

I gave this project a **6 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because the presentation seemed too short.
- **1 point** taken because the presenter seemed to be nervous, and it was hard to follow the presentation.
- **1 point** taken because I feel that the presentation was not structured well.
- **1 point** taken because I did not manage to see how the React library is used.

In summary, Dioxus emerges as a promising endeavor, leveraging Rust's prowess to offer an alternative to Electron.

Although my understanding remained incomplete due to the presentation's limitations, the potential of this project in bridging gaps left me intrigued.

LinkFree is a tool that allows you to create a personal landing page, with links to your social media profiles.

While social media platforms may not be my preferred avenue of engagement, I acknowledge the value this project brings to those seeking a centralized platform to promote their online personas.
Although I limit my social media presence to LinkedIn and GitHub, LinkFree caters to a wider range of social media enthusiasts.

In my pursuit to comprehend this project, I consulted my peers and discovered a similar offering known as LinkTree.
Comparing the two, I endeavored to discern the distinctive features and benefits of LinkFree.

Unfortunately, after watching the presentation of this project, my personal note on this project is 6.

I've rated it as a 6 because I did not like the following:

- **3 points** taken because I did not understand the use case for this project.
- **1 point** taken because the presentation seemed too focused on selling this product.

As with any endeavor, personal preferences and needs play a significant role in determining the fit of a project like LinkFree.
Although it may not resonate with my specific requirements, I recognize its potential value for those seeking a comprehensive online presence through centralized landing pages.

In conclusion, LinkFree empowers individuals to curate personal landing pages, connecting them with their social media profiles.
While I navigate a more limited social media landscape, LinkFree provides a valuable solution for those seeking a cohesive online presence.

### Seamly 2D

![Seamly 2D logo](../../github-accelerator/seamless-logo.jpg)

I found this presentation to be `out of the ordinary` so to speak.
The presenter seemed to know the industry where this project was targeted at, however, the explanation of the project was not clear.

I was cool to see a CAD-like application built in Qt.
I think that this project has a lot of potential, and I think that it can be used to build a lot of cool products.

I've rated this project as a **7 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because the presenter's explanation of the project was not clear, for the uninitiated in the fashion industry.
- **1 point** taken because the presentation seemed to not have any `solid` substance.
- **1 point** taken because the given resource (the project's website) was loading slow and it was hard to follow.

Despite these minor setbacks, Seamly 2D remains an enticing endeavor, pushing the boundaries of CAD applications in the realm of fashion design.
The project's potential for enabling novel and imaginative creations within the industry should not be underestimated.

Embark on a journey with Seamly 2D, an exploration of CAD-like applications poised to revolutionize the fashion landscape.
While the project's presentation may have faltered in certain aspects, it reflects an exciting opportunity for innovation and creative expression.

### nbdev

![nbdev logo](../../github-accelerator/nbdev-logo.png)

The project presentation seemed very dull.
I mean - the concept seemed cool, but the way that it was presented was not that great.

I believe that the concept is flawed, however.
Doing all your development and documentation in Jupyter Notebooks, seems, for me, to be puzzling.
Why would you store your documentation in a Jupyter notebook instead of a proper documentation medium?

I've rated this project as a **6 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because the presentation seemed rather empty.
- **2 points** because I do not believe in this product's vision - documentation is important, but having it in a Jupyter Notebook doesn't seem to be an `enterprise` solution.
- **1 point** taken because there was no live demo of the product, for the uninitiated.

Despite these setbacks, nbdev remains an intriguing venture, harnessing the power of Jupyter Notebooks in the realm of development and documentation.
However, concerns regarding its suitability as an all-encompassing solution for enterprise needs persist.

Uncover the possibilities of nbdev, an exploration into the fusion of Jupyter Notebooks and development.
While the project presentation may have left much to be desired, the concept itself invites further examination and evaluation of its practicality within specific use cases.

### Formbricks

![Formbricks logo](../../github-accelerator/formbricks-logo.png)

This project seemed really cool in my opinion!

I really loved the presentation and the demos!
It showed that this project is in good hands.

For me, being able to get the right feedback at the right time and from the right individual is **crucial**.
I was sold on this project from the first minute of the presentation.

However, I did rate this project as a **9 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because I would have wanted to see how this product differentiates from other alternatives.

Join the realm of Formbricks, an innovation dedicated to streamlining form management for unparalleled user experiences.
Embrace the harmonious fusion of efficiency and effectiveness as you navigate the intricacies of form handling.

### Sniffnet

![Sniffnet logo](../../github-accelerator/sniffnet-logo.png)

This project was pretty cool.

Unveiling an alternative to renowned network sniffers like Wireshark and TCP dump, Sniffnet breathes new life into the scene.
Healthy competition fosters growth and innovation, and Sniffnet's presence adds a refreshing dimension.

The presentation was interesting - I felt that there was too much weight on the user experience, instead of features.
However, I am confident that this project will revitalize the scene of network sniffers.

I have rated this project a **8 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because I felt that the presentation was more oriented in creating a good user experience than on bringing new features.
- **1 point** taken because I felt that the presenter was a bit aggresive towards the scene of network sniffers - there was a whole slide of showing how Sniffnet has MORE followers than Wireshark.

It's important to note that I hold a different view regarding Wireshark's efficacy. Having utilized Wireshark at Microsoft, working with Fortune 500 companies and analyzing massive data traffic volumes with ease, I can attest to its proficiency.

At present, I believe that Wireshark remains a formidable product, and while Sniffnet shows promise, only time will truly reveal its practicality and performance.
Stay tuned for the unfolding of this exciting venture.

### PyPandoc

(I was not able to find the logo of this project)

I did not really understand the meaning of this project.
I understood that this project is basically a document converter - such as from Markdown to PDF, or from Markdown to HTML.

Unfortunately, I do not see this product's use case or vision.
I believe that document converters should be implemented to be as user friendly as possible.

Having to know python code to run this converter is a no for me.

Why I think this way? Because, as a programmer, I know how to convert different document formats with ease, or I have the knowledge to be able to find out how to do this.

As a non-programmer, I would love to be able to convert a .txt file to a .pdf file for example, but again, I am a non-programmer.

If I have to read about python code just to be able to convert some documents, you lost me, as a potential consumer.

I have rated this project a **6 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **3 points** because I felt that this product does not have a solid use case or vision.
- **1 point** because I would have loved to see a demo of this product, perhaps my vision was skewed.

Rest assured, the true extent of PyPandoc's capabilities may warrant further exploration.
Witnessing a demonstration could provide valuable insight, potentially altering one's perspective.

### Mockoon

![Mockoon logo](../../github-accelerator/mockoon-logo.png)

This project seemed pretty cool - until it seemed to complex!

At first, I was really skeptical - as I used to be a React developer, I was used to using the `json-server` library to mock APIs with JSON data.

However, this project does much more than mock an API by using a JSON source of data.

And - this is where I draw the line.

I believe that, in your early development phase, it's ok to have a library that mocks the actual API, just to be able to scaffold out your code.
However, this library (or project) aims to do much more:

- CLI integration for streamlined testing.
- Request and response logging akin to popular tools like Postman.
- Powerful request and response rule management for robust validations.
- Customizable routes for creating mock APIs.

All in all, this project does a lot of things.
I consider this project interesting, but not for me.

I would arguably stick with `json-server` in the early phase of development, until I get the scaffolding done right.

`Mockoon` seems like a great tool for an indie company or startups - however, for the enterprise area, I don't see its place.

I have rated this project a **7 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because I did not resonate with the vision of the project.
- **1 point** because I felt that this project did not showcase it's full potential - why would we need such a complex project? What does it do better than other projects?
- **1 point** because I felt that the presenter wanted to sell this product more than showcase it's usefulness.

It is worth exploring Mockoon further, particularly for those seeking a comprehensive API mocking and testing solution.
A deeper understanding of its capabilities may reveal its value and utility for specific development scenarios.

### Datasette

![Datasette logo](../../github-accelerator/datasette-logo.svg)

The presenter of this project was the author of the project!

I liked the way the author made a story about this project and tried to expose the product's feature in the story.
I enjoyed watching the presentation and I felt that the demo was really good too.

Unfortunately, I only rate this project **9 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken since I felt that the author wanted to achieve a lot of goals, instead of polishing up the whole project.

### Strawberry

![Strawberry logo](../../github-accelerator/strawberry-logo.png)

Strawberry's presenter was one of the most hyped presenters in the conference!

It was an interesting project, however, it just did not stick with me because of two main things:

- I am not an active Python Developer, and from what I've seen, I wouldn't want to use this library for GraphQL purposes, simply because I feel that it's not `pythonic`
- I feel that having a bunch of @strawberry decorators in my code seems weird - instead of separating GraphQL types / schemas, I have them bundled up in my Python code..?

I have rated this project a **7 out of 10** because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken because I don't see this product in an enterprise medium, so far.
- **1 point** taken because I believe that there could be improvements to the already existing GraphQL libraries for Python, instead of creating a whole new library.
- **1 point** because I feel like the development of this project is not really comitted - there's 63 GitHub branches, 84 PRs and 603 tags - is this a corporation or a small development team?

While these concerns persist, I acknowledge the potential of Strawberry to empower Python developers seeking GraphQL integration.
Exploring its capabilities firsthand will provide further insights into its suitability for individual projects.

For additional information about Strawberry, including its latest updates and contributions, I recommend visiting the project's GitHub repository.

### Poly (or `Bebop Bio`?)

![Bebop Bio logo](../../github-accelerator/bebop-bio-logo.png)

This project was rather confusing in terms of naming conventions.

From what I understood, `Bebop Bio` is kind of a framework that uses three packages:

- Poly: a GO package for `engineering organisms`...
- ARK: don't really know what this package is..?
- Nitro UI: a TypeScript / React library for components used in life sciences.

Now, the presentation was focused on the whole `Bebop Bio` project, even though the headline of the project was `Poly`, not `Bebop Bio`.

The presenter had a lot of energy and it showed! It was a great presentation.

Unfortunately, it did not properly stick with me, since I felt that there were a lot of details that were still not clear enough or presented clearly.

As such, I rate this project a **6 out of 10** points for the following minuses:

- **2 points** for the vision - I feel that I was showcased a lot of things, but I did not understand the vision of the project.
- **1 point** for the presentation - I felt that there was no solid substrate to describe the project.
- **1 point** taken because I would have loved to see a demo or have more concrete details to look at, such as resources.

### tRPC

tRPC is a really nice project that showcases the power of type hinting in TypeScript.
I've really liked the project and the presenter described it quite well.

I've rated this project a solid **8 out of 10** points, because of the following minuses:

- **1 point** taken since I felt that this product is not yet mature enough to be used in production.
- **1 point** taken because I felt that the demo could be a bit more practical - I felt that the demo was a bit too simple and it didn't showcase the power of the product.

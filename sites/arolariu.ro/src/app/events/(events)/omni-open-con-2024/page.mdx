# ## The OmniOpenCon conference

OmniOpenCon is a gathering of people, projects and communities involved in all things open: open source, open data, open science, open hardware, open education. It is a place to meet, exchange ideas and collaborate. It is a place to learn, to teach, to hack, to invent, to create.

OmniOpenCon is free as in free speech and as in free beer: everyone is welcome to attend for free, and all information and resources are publicly available. We follow the example and the spirit of FOSDEM.

FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. The event is free to attend, and all information and resources are publicly available.

OmniOpenCon is a 3 day event that consists of a conference (talks) in the first day, workshops in the second day and a hackathon in the third day.

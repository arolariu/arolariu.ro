# In order to get a build up and running, you need to configure some environment variables.
# Currently, the way the front-end is architectured, you need to have a `.env` file or a `.env.local` file present before build time, otherwise the build will simply fail.


# In this example env file you can see what environment variables MUST be configured in order for the frontend web application to work seamlessly.
# Take into consideration that you should NEVER submit those secrets in any versioning system, and if you do, you WILL need to rotate the exposed secrets ASAP.

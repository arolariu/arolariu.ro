/// This document filter is automatically applied during Swagger document generation and performs two main functions:

/// <para>
/// <strong>Endpoint Filtering:</strong>
/// Removes internal or infrastructure endpoints from the public API documentation to keep the documentation
/// focused on business functionality. Filtered endpoints include health checks and utility endpoints
/// that are not intended for public consumption.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Documentation Enhancement:</strong>
/// Adds references to external documentation sources, providing API consumers with additional resources
/// for comprehensive API understanding and integration guidance.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The filter is registered automatically through the Swagger configuration and executes during
/// the document generation process, ensuring that the final OpenAPI specification reflects
/// only the intended public API surface.

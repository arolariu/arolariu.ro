# GitHub Actions workflow that builds the `about.arolariu.ro` static site artifact bundle.
# This GitHub action does four main things:
# 1. Checks out the repository inside the runner environment.
# 2. Installs HUGO - the static site generator framework utility.
# 3. Builds the static site using HUGO.
# 4. Uploads the built artifact to an Azure Static Web Application.
